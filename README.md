# credit-risk-classification
The goal of this analysis is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the credit risk of loan applicants using historical loan data from a peer-to-peer lending platform. This model helps identify which applicants are likely to default (high-risk loans) and which are likely to repay (healthy loans), allowing the company to make better lending decisions.

Summary
The logistic regression model performed exceptionally well in predicting loan outcomes. It predicted healthy loans with perfect accuracy, and high-risk loans with strong precision and recall. The high recall (95%) for risky loans is especially important, as it ensures that most potentially dangerous loans are caught.

Given the modelâ€™s high overall accuracy and strong performance on both labels, it is recommended for use by the company as a tool to evaluate borrower creditworthiness. While no model is perfect, this one strikes a good balance between identifying risk and avoiding false alarms.
